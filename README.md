# Kit

This is a tool to enable local development of containerized applications.

- It allows you to specify a set of **tasks** that run in **containers** or as **host processes**.
- You can specify **liveness probes** for your tasks to see if they've working, they're automatically restarting them
  when they go wrong.
- You can specify **readiness probes** for your tasks to see if they're ready.
- You can specify **dependencies** between tasks, so that upstream one tasks become successful or ready downstream tasks
  are automatically started.
- Tasks run concurrently and their status is **muxed into a single terminal window** so you're not overwhelmed by
  pages of terminal output.
- You can specify **watches on your source code changes**, tasks are automatically re-run, and your app restarts.
- When you're done, **ctrl+c** to and they're all cleanly stopped.
- **Logs are captured** so you can look at them anytime.

You could think of it as `docker compose up` or `podman kube play` that supports host processes, or `foreman` that
supports containers.

Tilt, Skaffold, and Garden are in the same problem space, but they all cross the boundary into deployment and often require Kubernetes.

You could also use is a more sophisticated `make -j4`.

## Install

```bash
brew tap alexec/kit --custom-remote https://github.com/alexec/kit
brew install kit
```

## Usage

Create your [`tasks.yaml`](tasks.yaml) file, then start:

```bash
kit up
```

You'll see something like this:

Logs are stored in `./logs`.

### Container

The `image` field can be either:

1. An conventional image tag. E.g. `ubunutu`.
2. A path to a a directory containing contain a `Dockerfile`, e.g. `.foo`.

If it is a path to a directory containing `Dockerfile`, that file is built, and tagged.

```yaml
    # conventional image? run in Docker
    - name: baz
      image: httpd
    # path image? build and run in Docker
    - name: qux
      image: demo/qux
```

Any container with the same name as the container name in the YAML is stopped and re-created whenever the process
starts.

### Host Process

If `image` field is omitted, the value of `command` is used to start the process on the host:

```yaml
    # no image? this is a host process
    - name: foo
      command: [ go, run, ./demo/foo ]
```
### Noop

If `image` field is omitted and `command` is omitted, the task does nothing, running forever.

### Auto Rebuild and Restart

You can specify a set of files to watch for changes that result in a re-build:

```yaml
  - watch: demo/bar
    name: bar
```        

### Liveness Probe

If the process is not alive (i.e. "dead"), then it is killed and restarted. Just like Kubernetes.

### Quitting

Enter Ctrl+C to send a `SIGTERM` to the process. Each sub-process is then gets sent `SIGTERM`. If they do not exit
within 30s, then they get a `SIGKILL`. You may wish to reduce this number:

```yaml
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 3
```

You can kill the tool using `kill` for another terminal. If you `kill -9`, then the sub-process will keep
running and you must manually clean up.

## Killing One Process

* To kill a host process: `kill $(lsof -ti:$host_port)`
* To kill a container process: `docker kill $name`.
